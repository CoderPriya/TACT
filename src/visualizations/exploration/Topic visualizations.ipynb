Jean Chretien, and his 'Team-Canada' visits to China, further strengthen Canadian's economic trade with China.

Some natural medicine IS more effective or has a beneficial effects without the side effects. The reason why there is not a lot of supporting evidence behind it, is because big pharma can't make money patenting a formula for something that is natural. There is no incentive for them to conduct studies. That doesn't mean it doesn't work. After all, many of the most used medicines are formulations derived by compounding and concentrating plants that have proven to have certain effects. Where natural medicine fails (depending on one's definition off failure) is that it is often less potent. So for one pill of pharma, you may have to take 3 pills, 3 times a day to get the same effects. Also, everyone is different. Even medications are effective on some, but not on others.

Rand nicknamed Greenspan 'the undertaker' because of his penchant for dark clothing and reserved demeanor. Although Greenspan was initially a logical positivist,[52] he was converted to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism by her associate Nathaniel Branden. He became one of the members of Rand's inner circle, the Ayn Rand Collective, who read Atlas Shrugged while it was being written. During the 1950s and 1960s Greenspan was a proponent of Objectivism, writing articles for Objectivist newsletters and contributing several essays for Rand's 1966 book Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal including an essay supporting the gold standard.[53][54] Rand stood beside him at his 1974 swearing-in as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Then, in the 1990's (particularly the last few years of the decade), their share of income dropped quite a bit to 16.6% in 2000. Since 2000? It's barely changed at 16.4%.Similar story with other individuals. From 1976 until about 1994 not much changed. Then from 1994 through 2000 the bottom 4 quintiles lost ground and the top quintile gained. Since 2000 through the income share of the top quintile has decreased very slightly but mostly nothing much has changed. Looking at unattached individuals the share of income increased from 2000 to 2011 for the 4 bottom quintiles while the top quintile saw their share of income decrease. About the only thing that is resulting in a 'shrinking middle class' has a lot less to do about actual changes in income earned and a lot more to do with the fact that there are simply a lot more unattached individuals than there are families today.

If anyone is interested, there is a wealth of excellent material about the War of 1812. All of it covers First Nations participation, to a greater or lesser extent and with a greater or lesser sensitivity to the First Nations point-of-view.If people are interested particularly in Tecumseh, Sudgen's work really is the best place to start. A few years ago, Sandy Antal wrote a book that attempts to rehabilitate Proctor.

It might also be added that we should not take too much comfort from the fact that the trends in question have not advanced as much in Canada as in the US and some other major, advanced and modern societies. First, these trends have advanced (and are advancing at a faster rate recently) here. This is worrying in itself and may also indicate that we are simply laging in this transition. Second, the primary factors that have kept these trends at bay somewhat in Canada are themselves fading. The public policies (and the funding for their implimentation) that have butressed social mobility (quality primary, secondary and post secondary education available on an almost universal basis, universal health care, income support for middle income as well as needy beneficiaries etc.) in the 1940s, 50s and 60s especially are being narrowed and cut back continually. The portion of the workforce covered by trade union negotiated working conditions including significant fringe benefit packages such as defined benefit pension and supplimental health benefits is srinking as are and middle management and skilled trades positions. Third, these worrying trends would have become much more obvious and apparent by the 1970s save for the growth of availability of consumer credit and the two income family household - further amelioration from these factors should not now be expected (i.e. these are one time gains that don't enlarge after their initial impact).Fourth, globalization and information technology, while arguably beneficial in several important ways, may well speed-up the impact in Canada of the worrying trends in question. In conclusion, we should be neither complacent or resigned within Canada in face of these trends. Nore can we expect to succeed by simply legislating the maintenance of programs and funding unless we at the same time also find sustainable ways of paying for this while maintaining a sound economy. This is not, however, to say that unfettered classic free market laissez- faire capitalism offers a road forward - in fact, in many ways it simply speeds up the stratification of society into casts in a mature economy such as we have in Canada.

The first comprehensive written treaty between the English and the Wabanaki (a collective description that includes a number of closely related peoples including the Mi'kmaq) on the Atlantic seaboard was signed in 1693. The 1693 treaty contains a clause that very clearly and specifically recognizes and reserves Aboriginal Title except where the English have clearly established their own ownership of parcels of land. There were a number of subsequent written treaties through the early-18th century that built on the principles and wording of the 1693 agreement. In December, 1725, the Wabanaki and the British came to a new major comprehensive set of articles at Boston, ending Dummer's War. The Mi'kmaq were definitely represented at that meeting -- it is unclear whether they were directly represented at early ones. The 1725 Boston Treaty duplicated the Aboriginal Title clause from the articles of agreement of 1693. There was much discussion of it during the detailed negotiations. The 1725 Boston Treaty was considered the template for all subsequent Wabanaki-British treaties. The Mi'kmaq explicitly ratified it at Annapolis Royal in 1726. Subsequent treaties up to and including the Mi'kmaq ones in 1760-61 ending the Seven Years' War often simply renewed the 1725 Boston articles, while adding some modifications. The treaties clearly affirm Mi'kmaq and Maliseet Aboriginal Title. Following 1761, there was never an effort made to achieve surrender of Aboriginal Title in what are now the Maritime provinces.

In 1994, Mr. Justice Nadon was appointed Judge of the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada and, in 1998, a judicial member of the Competition Tribunal. Prior to his appointment to the Federal Court, Mr. Justice Nadon was a lawyer and partner at Fasken Martineau Walker in Montreal, including a stint in the London, United Kingdom office of that firm. Mr. Justice Nadon has regularly pleaded cases before all levels of Quebec and national courts, including the Quebec Court of Appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.

She was called to the Ontario Bar in 1972 and practised civil and criminal litigation until 1976 when she was appointed to the Ontario Family Court. She was appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1992. She was the sole Commissioner of the 1984 federal Royal Commission on Equality in Employment, creating the term and concept of 'employment equity'. The theories of 'equality' and 'discrimination' she developed in her report were adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in its first decision dealing with equality rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1989. The report has been implemented by the governments of Canada, New Zealand, Northern Ireland and South Africa. She subsequently served as Chair of the Ontario Labour Relations Board (1984 to 1989), Chair of the Ontario Law Reform Commission (1989 to 1992), and Boulton Visiting Professor at the Faculty of Law of McGill University (1988 to 1992). She also served as a commissioner on the Ontario Human Rights Commission; as a member of the Ontario Public Service Labour Relations Tribunal; as Co-Chair of the University of Toronto Academic Discipline Tribunal; as a member of the Premier's Advisory Committee on Confederation; and as Chair of the Study on Access to Legal Services by the Disabled.

The first question that should be asked is what legitimate function of government (if any) would be better served if Canada had a second chamber. The point here is that before a useful change (i.e. abolition, elected membership, appointment of Senators by the Provinces, term limits, changed membership criteria etc. etc.) can be devised we first need to clearly ascertain whether/why the Senate as an institution should exist and therefore the appropriate membership to fulfill this role. 2. If the answer to point 1 is that the Senate should continue to exist in its current limited role (or that abolition is preferable but, as a practical political matter, unattainable), then the House of Commons in consultation with the Senate should strike a balanced or nonpartisan committee to propose:(a) a better selection process for appointments to the Senate (possibly patterned upon that for judicial appointments, and(b) a set of rules for internal management of senate expenses and for the administration of these rules. Arguably Senate reform is one of those issues which both lacks fundamental importance requiring a big Federal/Provincial or political dust-up (a bit like whether Canada should change the role of the monarchy) and about which key decision makers will not agree.

I'd just like to clarify the point about the rise in the estimate for Canada, which my original research papers put at about one-fifth of inequality being passed on across the generations (an elasticity of 0.2), and my more current research suggesting about one-quarter or more (an elasticity of about 0.3).This does not reflect a new estimate for more recent cohorts of young adult men, but rather an updating. When I first explored the data about a decade and a half ago I used information from Statistics Canada on a group of men born in the mid 1960s and observing their adult incomes in the late 1990s when they were in their early 30s. I always felt that this was an underestimate of the true estimate, even though it was the only estimate we had. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to update these data and recalculate the estimate for the same group of individuals, but observing their adult incomes when they were in their early to mid 40s. And the new estimate reflects that updating. What is happening to younger cohorts of people requires us to look at intermediate outcomes that fall short of capturing their adult incomes because data on them is not available yet, or maybe never will be. That is what some of my more recent papers have done .... particularly in comparison with the United States, which I feel is a more relevant country to be comparing ourselves to than, say, Denmark.

Everything hinges on projected rates of return which cause problems if they don't match projections. No doubt professionally managed DB plans have better rates of return than DC plans, but as the increases in the CPP contributions rates have shown having a DB plan does not guarantee sustainability on its own. The lower contribution rates in the USA plan means it will run out of money eventually to pay current benefits. A DC plan is attractive to employers because of its known cost. It transfers the responsibility of pensions from the employer to the employee. That this will mean a lower pension payout to the employee is seen as not being the responsibility of the employer. If the employer is the government (read taxpayer) it becomes more of a popular position. The question comes down to whether the government should take the risk of future unfunded liabilities in order to give its employees a better pension.\",\n",

Most global electric power generation, currently fuelled by natural gas and coal, could be converted to ammonia to produce power at savings of between 30% and 50% of the cost of using natural gas directly. To supply this demand, ammonia production would have to increase massively: about a hundred-fold.

       " 'Database -Well said. Canada in the post WW II era adopted a middle course in pension public policy between the excessive reliance adopted in the US upon company pensions and the Western European model of public pensions. The OAP coupled with the Income Supplement reflected the European approach and provided a very modest pension foundation for all, without regard to employment income, at public expense. The CPP (and the QPP) was a creative compromise between employer based and government pension plans designed to require employees to save (and their employers to contribute) towards an pension entitlement beyond OAP levels and safe from the constraints of traditional private company plans. Through tax inducements individuals and employers were further encouraged to establish registered pension plans (i.e. Plans meeting standards of quality and entitlement monitored by specialist institutions, professionals and public authorities to protect the funds collected). Arguably this was a creative approach provided that, across these three levels of pension schemes, the funding levels and responsibilities and the pension entitlements were continually revised in a timely manner to reflect changing demographic and cost of living patterns. Arguably this is something that some employer groups and the current Conservative Government are not now doing in good faith (i.e. implicitly they are shifting burdens to individuals to an irresponsible extent from a public policy perspective).The thrust of many corporations now, as you correctly observe, is to undercut the preferred form of earlier registered pension planning (i.e. the guaranteed benefit plan) by pressuring employees to either move to defined contribution plans or to RRSPs (i.e. shifting the risk of a shortfall within the pension fund from the employer decisively to the employee). The Conservative Government is compounding this shift unto the shoulders of people during their working lives by purposely allowing the CPP to go unreformed and touting the registered plan route.',\n",

So pension isn't actually based on fund returns. A Canadian index fund over the same period would return 8% and this period includes the big crash. So lets look at returns. Assuming I get paid full pension, I would make $1013 a month. If instead of CPP, if I were to save that 10% of income up to 50k every year for 30 years at 8% return in an RRSP, I would have nearly 600k. However, I should adjust for inflation so I'll make that a nominal rate of return and I'll only save 342k. With that money, at 65, I could buy a monthly annuity of $1672.00.So I'm still not sure how the CPP is a good deal.\",\n",

It would be price neutral because business would have a tax reduction. The new premiums would not be a cost to employers, and the new system would be a tax cut for business.

Arguable the course of events following that 1848 upsurge suggest a likely pattern for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) today. Liberal and more radical urban middle class and some progressive aristocrats during 1848 harnessed the deep discontent of the urban poor with initial success to over through or seriously threaten reactionary regimes in France, throughout the German States, in the Austrian Empire etc. etc. What followed over the next couple of years was success by the autocratic regimes in these countries to harness the army, rural masses, traditional forces and many of the middle class that, while initially open to liberal change, were frightened by the ensuing chaos. Many commentators by 1850 were concluding, with real evidence to back these conclusions, that the ascendancy of autocracy and conservative reaction which had followed the Napoleonic Wars after 1815 (and which were seriously but unsuccessfully challenged in 1848) had fully reasserted itself and would be in unchallenged control for the indefinite future.

Changes in the economy and the resulting shifts in class power and from the rural to urban centres set the framework (and the autocrats and aristocrats increasingly made their peace with the urban middle class to retain a diminished share of political and economic power). Arguably, something similar is underway in the MENA but, like in mid 19th century Europe, reaction and progress will jockey for years before modernity becomes firmly rooted. Switzerland was an exception in 1848 Europe as there moderate liberals triumphed after a civil war with more reactionary elements (and a moderate but progressive compromise followed). Perhaps Tunisia will be the modern Switzerland in the MENA context (avoiding thereby much of the turmoil the others will endure and illustrating a progressive but moderate way forward to modernity in an Islamic context balanced by secular and liberal democratic aspects).',\n",

These teachers will not be discouraged by anything: not salary constraints, not Ministry directives, nor criticism from the public. Their unwavering commitment to kids is precisely why they are so remarkable. Having taught in the public elementary system for 32 years, I can say that I worked alongside several teachers who were absolute legends, both in terms of in-class instruction and after-school extra-curriculars. They were often (but not always) the first teachers on-site in the morning and usually the last ones to leave after 5 pm.\",\n",

A certain teacher may sometimes 'do less' but often there are valid (usually temporary) reasons for this: a child with a serious illness, an infirm parent, a difficult pregnancy, etc. Complementarity counts for a lot as well. Personally, I love coaching and yard duty. Ask me to teach Dance or explain the intracies of certain Provincial Curriculum documents and I would probably struggle. Other teachers rarely assist with athletics but lead the Christmas concert, the school play, Chess Club, Primary Helpers, etc. There's more going on in schools than meets the eye and many diverse ways that teachers can (and do) contribute.\",\n",

Global warming is the general, overall rise in the total heat of the planet: atmosphere and ocean. Climate change is a change in settled characteristics of the planet's atmosphere, including distribution of heat regionally together with the patterns of current that accomplish those distributions. The reason that the two terms are used differently is because they ARE different. Global warming (one phenomenon), in fact, can (and does) cause climate change. But since climate change implies changes in pattern of distribution and circulation, not all global warming and resulting climate change implies an elevated temperature in every location. Uneven distribution of change means that some places will get very warm and a few others might even get cooler. For example, if the change in distribution of the planet's heat resulted in slowing down of the ocean currents that bring relatively warm water to the North Atlantic where it gradually cools and subsides, Europe might cool. Neither 'global warming' nor 'climate change' are shibboleths. They are terms for different things.
