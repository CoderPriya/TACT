Topic Analysis, Constructiveness and Toxicity for online articles and comments

## Project Overview

We set out to investigate trends in the toxicity, constructiveness and topics of online comments. Online comments by themselves are interesting but it also helps to look at them in context - we do this using information about the articles on which these comments appeared.

To find these trends, we use various machine-learning-based systems and approaches. For constructiveness, we use **_REFERENCE_**, a constructiveness system developed at Simon Fraser University by Dr Maite Taboada and Dr Varada Kolhatkar. For toxicity, we use Google's Perspective API. For topic modelling, we settled on creating a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, the details of which are discussed in subsequent sections.

The results of this project will provide insights to online news publications that monitor the comment sections on their websites.
